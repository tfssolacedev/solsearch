## 🧩 What is Solace?

**Solace** is a powerful, lightweight, privacy-first search engine designed to be self-hosted by individuals and organizations who value control, speed, and transparency.

It allows users to index websites, documents, PDFs, markdown files, and more — all while staying fully independent from third-party indexing services.

Each domain I index costs me £10 to register. That’s why I maintain strict control over what gets indexed and how the system is used.
